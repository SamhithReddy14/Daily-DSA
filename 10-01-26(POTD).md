# 712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings

## Problem Statement

Given two strings s1 and s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.

## Examples

### Example 1:

Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"  
Output: 231  
Explanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the sum. Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum. At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

### Example 2:

Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"  
Output: 403  
Explanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let", adds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum. Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum. At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403. If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.

## Constraints

- 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000
- s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeleteSum(String s1, String s2) {
        int n = s1.length();
        int m = s2.length();
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][m+1];

        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + s1.charAt(i-1);
        }

        for(int j = 1; j <= m; j++){
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + s2.charAt(j-1);
        }

        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= m; j++){
                if(s1.charAt(i-1) == s2.charAt(j-1)){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(
                        dp[i-1][j] + s1.charAt(i-1),
                        dp[i][j-1] + s2.charAt(j-1)
                    );
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][m];
    }
}
```

## Explanation

This problem is solved using dynamic programming. We define a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters to make the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` equal.

### Base Cases:
- `dp[i][0]` for `i` from 1 to `n`: This is the sum of ASCII values of the first `i` characters of `s1`, as we need to delete all of them to make it equal to an empty `s2`.
- `dp[0][j]` for `j` from 1 to `m`: Similarly, the sum of ASCII values of the first `j` characters of `s2`.

### Transition:
- If `s1.charAt(i-1) == s2.charAt(j-1)`, the characters match, so no deletion is needed for these characters. Thus, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
- If they don't match, we have two choices:
  - Delete the current character from `s1`, adding its ASCII value to the sum: `dp[i-1][j] + s1.charAt(i-1)`
  - Delete the current character from `s2`, adding its ASCII value: `dp[i][j-1] + s2.charAt(j-1)`
  - Take the minimum of these two options.

The final answer is `dp[n][m]`, which gives the minimum sum to make the entire strings equal.
