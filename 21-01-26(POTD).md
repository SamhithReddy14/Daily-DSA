# 3315. Construct the Minimum Bitwise Array II

## Problem Description

You are given an array `nums` consisting of `n` prime integers.

You need to construct an array `ans` of length `n`, such that, for each index `i`, the bitwise OR of `ans[i]` and `ans[i] + 1` is equal to `nums[i]`, i.e. `ans[i] OR (ans[i] + 1) == nums[i]`.

Additionally, you must minimize each value of `ans[i]` in the resulting array.

If it is not possible to find such a value for `ans[i]` that satisfies the condition, then set `ans[i] = -1`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [2,3,5,7]`  
**Output:** `[-1,1,4,3]`  

**Explanation:**  
- For `i = 0`, as there is no value for `ans[0]` that satisfies `ans[0] OR (ans[0] + 1) = 2`, so `ans[0] = -1`.  
- For `i = 1`, the smallest `ans[1]` that satisfies `ans[1] OR (ans[1] + 1) = 3` is `1`, because `1 OR (1 + 1) = 3`.  
- For `i = 2`, the smallest `ans[2]` that satisfies `ans[2] OR (ans[2] + 1) = 5` is `4`, because `4 OR (4 + 1) = 5`.  
- For `i = 3`, the smallest `ans[3]` that satisfies `ans[3] OR (ans[3] + 1) = 7` is `3`, because `3 OR (3 + 1) = 7`.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [11,13,31]`  
**Output:** `[9,12,15]`  

**Explanation:**  
- For `i = 0`, the smallest `ans[0]` that satisfies `ans[0] OR (ans[0] + 1) = 11` is `9`, because `9 OR (9 + 1) = 11`.  
- For `i = 1`, the smallest `ans[1]` that satisfies `ans[1] OR (ans[1] + 1) = 13` is `12`, because `12 OR (12 + 1) = 13`.  
- For `i = 2`, the smallest `ans[2]` that satisfies `ans[2] OR (ans[2] + 1) = 31` is `15`, because `15 OR (15 + 1) = 31`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`  
- `2 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`  
- `nums[i]` is a prime number.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] minBitwiseArray(List<Integer> nums) {
        int ans[] = new int[nums.size()];
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int n = nums.get(i);
            if(n != 2) ans[i] = n - ((n + 1) & (-n - 1)) / 2;
            else ans[i] = -1;
        }  
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Explanation of Solution

The solution iterates through each number in the input list. For each prime number `n`, it calculates the minimum `ans[i]` such that `ans[i] | (ans[i] + 1) == n`. The formula `n - ((n + 1) & (-n - 1)) / 2` is derived from bitwise operations to find the smallest number that, when ORed with its successor, gives `n`. For `n = 2`, it's impossible, so set to `-1`.
