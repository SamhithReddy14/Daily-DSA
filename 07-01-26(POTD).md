# 1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.

Return the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not after taking it.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
**Output:** 110  
**Explanation:** Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)

### Example 2:

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]  
**Output:** 90  
**Explanation:** Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6. Their product is 90 (15*6)

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5 * 10^4].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 10^4

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    long totalSum = 0;
    long maxProduct = 0;
    static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int maxProduct(TreeNode root) {
        totalSum = treeSum(root);
        maxProduct = 0;
        treeSum(root);
        return (int)(maxProduct % MOD);
    }

    private long treeSum(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        long left = treeSum(node.left);
        long right = treeSum(node.right);

        long subSum = node.val + left + right;

        long product = subSum * (totalSum - subSum);
        if (product > maxProduct) maxProduct = product;

        return subSum;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- First, compute the total sum of the entire tree using a DFS traversal.
- Then, perform another DFS to calculate the sum of each subtree and compute the product with the remaining sum.
- Track the maximum product encountered.
- Return the maximum product modulo 10^9 + 7.
