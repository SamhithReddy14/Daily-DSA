# 🧠 Daily DSA — Problem Solving Practice

This repository contains my daily problem-solving practice from platforms like:

- LeetCode
- GeeksforGeeks
- Smart Interviews
- Other competitive programming resources

I created this repo to track my consistency, improve problem-solving skills, and build a reference that I (and others) can revisit anytime.
